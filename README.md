## 📌 Executive Summary
This project explores the transition from **predicting credit risk** to **optimizing financial returns**. Using the LendingClub dataset (2007-2018), I developed and compared two distinct AI systems:
1.  **Supervised Deep Learning (DL):** A classifier optimized to predict default probability.
2.  **Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL):** A Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) agent optimized to maximize portfolio value.

**Core Finding:** While both models beat the human baseline, the **Optimized DL Model** proved superior. By strictly tuning the decision threshold to `0.25`, it reduced portfolio losses by **85%**, whereas the RL agent achieved a **26%** reduction.

## 📊 Key Results

| Strategy | Primary Metric | Approval Rate | Est. Policy Value (EPV) | Net Improvement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Human Baseline** | N/A | 100% | **-$1,805** per loan | - |
| **RL Agent (CQL)** | EPV | 95.2% | **-$1,339** per loan | +26% |
| **DL Model (Tuned)** | AUC / F1 | 65.6% | **-$273** per loan | **+85%** |
